# PHP Data Structures

Implementations and testing through PHPUnit of Data Structures made in PHP.

## Why PHP?

PHP Developers seems to be bored about their own work. We tend to make people think all we do is MacGyver some code
here and there, but PHP is a powerful language, and we must be more proud of our work!

That's why I'm beginning to build from scratch a study guide do data structure, a discipline so important for Computer
Science (which seems to be so far away of PHP for some "it's just a nephew programming language" reason) and base of
the most important algorithms every programmer should learn.
